	1.
	Git is the software allowing things we want to happen to happen as necessary
	Bash allows the user to interract with the Git. Github allows the sharing of the source
	code/files with others. It is in essence, a cloud system.
	
	2.
	Terminal is the GUI part where the commands are written and the Command Line is the place 
	with the comamnd that is being written.

	3.
	Powershell is the Windows version of the command system Gitbash is the Mac?? Apple Version???
	which uses different code
	
	4.
	Anaconda is used for convenient to use for science. VS Code usesdoes is capable of doing this
	 and more. Conda is the part that created the "isolated environment"???

	5.
	Jupyter according to my own experience is more useful for science usage as it already comes
	prepackaged with things needed for science such as pyplot, numpy, math and such. Jupyterlab 
	comes with about the same thing, The appearance seems to be different, jUPYTERLAB Allows
	the use of console which Jupyter does not.

	6.
	VS Code is a code editor/IDE which allows versatility in coding language beyond what Jupyter
	might allow. From memory, it can EVEN DO R code.

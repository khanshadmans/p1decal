Congratulations! You found the extra credit assignmnet!






------------------------------------------------------------






To complete this homework, follow these steps:

1) Take a screenshot of pulling, creating and checking out the local `extra_credit` branch from `brianna_repo`. 

2) In your local `<YOUR_NAME>_decal` repository, create a new branch called `extra_credit_hw`. Completely empty this branch, be careful! Make sure to add, commit and push before changing your current working directory. Take a screenshot.

3) Move or copy this `extra_credit.txt` file (the one you're reading now) from the `extra_credit` branch in `brianna_repo` into your `extra_credit_hw` branch in your `<YOUR_NAME>_decal` repository. Take a screenshot.

4) Make a copy of this `extra_credit.txt` file in your local repository. Rename it to `awesome.txt`, then answer the questions below inside that file. 

5) Answer these questions in your `awesome.txt` file:
- What command lists all branches in your repository, including both local and remote tracking branches?
- What does `remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main` mean?
- How is it different from `remotes/origin/main` and just `main`? 

6) Add, commit and push your `extra_credit_hw` branch from your local `<YOUR_NAME>_decal` repostory to your remote repository. Take a screenshot.

7) Upload ONLY your `extra_credit_hw` branch to Gradescope! Make sure the only files inside are:
- `extra_credit.txt`
- `awesome.txt`
- The four requested screenshots. 

All done!

(Yes, I know it's a lot of screenshots, but it's the best way to verify that you branched correctly!)

Pro Tip: You can continue branching for each homework assignment! For example, create a branch called `hw5` and keep only Homework 5 materials inside. This helps keeps your repository organized on Gradescope and makes grading easier for the Python DeCal Staff!
